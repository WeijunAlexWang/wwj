Biography
-----
Now, I am a research assistant and Ph.D student in [Computer Network Group](http://www.net.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/), Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Goettingen. My supervisors are Prof. [Xiaoming Fu](https://user.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/~fu/) (1st supervisor) and Prof. [Marcus Baum](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/523550.html) (2nd supervisor) from UGoettingen. Before, I was advised by Prof. [Guihai Chen](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/gchen/) (3rd supervisor) and Prof. [Haipeng Dai](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/daihp/), Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University.

I'm currently on the job market. I'm looking for a postdoc/researcher position where I can learn new things, tackle challenging problems, and build practical systems that have a real-world impact. Fell free to contact me!
